Suggestions
===========

* I put the non-package files in the inst directory (e.g., vicar.bib,
  revdep). Please check that this is okay.

* Have you tested your package in R 2.10? That is a pretty old
  version---I would check that it actually works in that version, or
  give a larger version number!
